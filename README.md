**SHARE PROPRIORITY CONTENT ON BLOCKCHAIN**

The current upsurge in the popularity of blockchain technology in global business is redefining companies, ecosystem and economic model. Being one of these new entrants, YOYOW, a content sharing platform based on public blockchain platform is challenging industry flagships such as Facebook by using new business models.“The value of users has never been respected as they should be."The value includes content generation, spread and community interaction. Users help social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter make huge profit, but users cannot get any reward from the platform, and this is irrational.”



**PROBLEM**
Original content is mis-credited or plagiarized. Social media personalities are building their brands using other people’s work and generating income from it. No outlet for content creators to safely upload their original work to serve as the golden record.
Increasing plagrism is a major concern online! As a all the data that has been stored online is on a single server storage, privacy of the content provider is completely dependent on the server provider as there is no transperency on how or where the content is being used until searched for. This also increases the chance of manipulated content sharing.



**SOLUTION**
Incentivize content creators to share their original work by building a platform that leverages blockchain technology to create a unique transaction and golden record. This will generate profit sharing opportunities and proper crediting.

**HOW IT ALL WORKS**


**IPFS** *(Inter Planetary File System)* and **Ethereum** *Blockchain*
These technology help us attain our primary goal of making a Distributed Web Model. (A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol
to make the web faster, safer, and more open.)

IPFS makes content Permanent on the Web and Blockchain makes it immpossible to Hack and Peer-Peer txns possible. this removes the concept of a single server extinct and gives content creaters enough flexibily and transperency on how and when their content is being used. 

 
- IPFS removes duplications across the network and tracks version history for every file keeping Storage in control.
- Each network node stores only content it is interested in, and some indexing information that helps figure out who is storing what.
- Every file can be found by human-readable names using a decentralized naming system called IPNS.


IPFS brings the freedom and independent spirit of the web at full force—and at low cost. IPFS can help deliver content in a way which can save you considerable money.

IPFS and the Blockchain are a perfect match! You can address large amounts of data with IPFS, and place the immutable, permanent IPFS links into a blockchain transaction. This timestamps and secures your content, without having to put the data on the chain itself.
